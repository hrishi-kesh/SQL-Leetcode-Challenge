-- Question 44
-- Table: Department

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | id            | int     |
-- | revenue       | int     |
-- | month         | varchar |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (id, month) is the primary key of this table.
-- The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
-- The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

-- Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Department table:
-- +------+---------+-------+
-- | id   | revenue | month |
-- +------+---------+-------+
-- | 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
-- | 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
-- | 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
-- | 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
-- | 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
-- +------+---------+-------+

-- Result table:
-- +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
-- | id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
-- +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
-- | 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
-- | 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
-- | 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
-- +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

-- Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).

-- Solution
select id,
sum(if(month='Jan',revenue,null)) as Jan_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Feb',revenue,null)) as Feb_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Mar',revenue,null)) as Mar_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Apr',revenue,null)) as Apr_Revenue,
sum(if(month='May',revenue,null)) as May_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jun',revenue,null)) as Jun_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jul',revenue,null)) as Jul_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Aug',revenue,null)) as Aug_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Sep',revenue,null)) as Sep_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Oct',revenue,null)) as Oct_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Nov',revenue,null)) as Nov_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Dec',revenue,null)) as Dec_Revenue
from Department
group by id

--Oracle solution
select id,
    sum(case when month='Jan' then revenue end) as Jan_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Feb' then revenue end) as Feb_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Mar' then revenue end) as Mar_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Apr' then revenue end) as Apr_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='May' then revenue end) as May_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Jun' then revenue end) as Jun_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Jul' then revenue end) as Jul_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Aug' then revenue end) as Aug_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Sep' then revenue end) as Sep_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Oct' then revenue end) as Oct_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Nov' then revenue end) as Nov_Revenue,
    sum(case when month='Dec' then revenue end) as Dec_Revenue
