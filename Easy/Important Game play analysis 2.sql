-- Question 9 
-- Table: Activity

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | player_id    | int     |
-- | device_id    | int     |
-- | event_date   | date    |
-- | games_played | int     |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- (player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
-- This table shows the activity of players of some game.
-- Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

-- Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Activity table:
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
-- | 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
-- | 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
-- | 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

-- Result table:
-- +-----------+-----------+
-- | player_id | device_id |
-- +-----------+-----------+
-- | 1         | 2         |
-- | 2         | 3         |
-- | 3         | 1         |
-- +-----------+-----------+


-- Solution
With table1 as
(
   Select player_id, device_id,
   Rank() OVER(partition by player_id
               order by event_date) as rk
   From Activity
)
Select t.player_id, t.device_id
from table1 as t
where t.rk=1

--2nd way --correlated subquery
select player_id, device_id
from Activity a
where event_date = (select min(event_date) from Activity where player_id = a.player_id);--correlated subquery
--This is a common pattern in SQL when you need to find attributes associated with extremes (first, last, highest, lowest) within groups.
--A correlated subquery is a subquery that references a column from the outer query. It is evaluated once per row of the outer query.

--3rd way ---- This solution uses an inline view (subquery in the FROM clause) with the analytic function ROW_NUMBER().
select player_id, device_id
from (select player_id, device_id,
             row_number() over(partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk
      from Activity)
where rnk = 1;
